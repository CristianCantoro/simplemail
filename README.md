simplemail
==========

A simple python script to send e-mails from the CLI.

Sometimes you need to send an e-mail from the CLI but for whatever reason you can not use `sendmail` or `mutt`.

Then download this repo, change the configuration in `scripts/mail.py`.

Pretty easy, uh?

And you have it:
`simplemail -s "I just sent an e-mail from the CLI" -m "Thanks to simplemail"`
